# vending-machine

1. It sells 4 items (400, 500, 1000, 2000)

2. It receives 3 types of coins (100, 500, 1000)

When a user inserts a coin, the vending machine shows all types of available items. (Assume that each item is never out of stock.)

When a user selects (buys) an item, the vending machine does one of the two. If the selected item is available, the item is sold and the user receives the item. If the selected item is not available, nothing happens.

When a user presses a return button, the vending machine returns all the changes (“the number” of coins). Assume that the machine has an infinite amount of changes available.
